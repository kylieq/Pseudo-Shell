# Pseudo-Shell
For this project, I implemented a pseudo-shell with the functionalities of numerous UNIX system commands (i.e. ls, pwd, mkdir, cd, cp, mv, rm, and cat). There are two modes a user may enter in the shell, file mode and interactive mode. In file mode, a text file must be provided. Within said file should be a string of commands where each command is separated by either a semicolon or a newline character. These delimiters enable the program to distinguish between the commands when parsing the file. In doing so, the string of text is broken down into smaller components which are to be worked on individually. Whether these components represent valid UNIX commands, the results provoked by them are all saved to a separate text file called “output.txt”. For the user’s convenience, this file is located in the same directory the shell is in. 

In interactive mode, the user must manually enter system commands. The shell stalls whilst awaiting input from the command line. As with file mode, once it receives a string of text, the shell breaks it down into smaller components for said components to be checked individually. However, unlike in file mode, the actions provoked by these commands are printed to the console rather than to a text file. After executing the given command, the shell proceeds to wait for another one. It does not terminate unless the user types “exit” on the command line.
